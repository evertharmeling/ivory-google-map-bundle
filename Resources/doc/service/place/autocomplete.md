# Place Autocomplete API

The Place Autocomplete service is a web service that returns place predictions in response to an HTTP request. The 
request specifies a textual search string and optional geographic bounds. The service can be used to provide 
autocomplete functionality for text-based geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and 
points of interest as a user types.

The Place Autocomplete service can match on full words as well as substrings. Applications can therefore send queries 
as the user types, to provide on-the-fly place predictions. The returned predictions are designed to be presented to the 
user to aid them in selecting the desired place. You can send a [Place Details](/Resources/doc/service/place/detail.md) 
request for more information about any of the places which are returned.

## Dependencies

The Place Autocomplete API requires an [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) http client and a serializer. Any PSR-18
http client library is suitable, [HttpClient](https://github.com/symfony/http-client) is a popular and steady choice nowadays.
And the [Ivory Serializer](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-serializer) which is an advanced (de)-serialization library.

To install them, read this [documentation](/Resources/doc/installation.md).

## Configuration

By default, the place autocomplete service is disabled. In order to enable the service, you need to configure it.

### Http client and message factory

The http client and message factory are mandatory. They define which http client and message factory the place 
autocomplete service will use for issuing http requests. Here we use `symfony/http-client` and `nyholm/psr7`.

Configure the Google Map bundle:

``` yaml
ivory_google_map:
    place_autocomplete:
        client: psr18.http_client
        message_factory: nyholm.psr7.psr17_factory
```

### Format

The format allows you to use json/xml format for your http request:

``` yaml
ivory_google_map:
    place_autocomplete:
        format: json
```

### Api key

The API key allows you to bypass Google limitation according to your account plan:

``` yaml
ivory_google_map:
    place_autocomplete:
        api_key: ~
```

### Business account

The business account allows you to use Google Premium account:

``` yaml
ivory_google_map:
    place_autocomplete:
        business_account:
            client_id: ~
            secret: ~
            channel: ~
```

## Usage

Once you have configured your place autocomplete service, you can fetch it from the container and use it as explained 
in the [documentation](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-google-map/blob/master/doc/service/place/autocomplete/place_autocomplete.md).

``` php
use Ivory\GoogleMap\Service\Place\Autocomplete\Request\PlaceAutocompleteRequest;

$request = new PlaceAutocompleteRequest('Sydney');
$response = $this->container->get('ivory.google_map.place_autocomplete')->process($request);
```
